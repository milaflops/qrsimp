this isn't done

# AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

the idea: make QR codes in the browser, without calling out to some external server or whatever, and without, like, *advertisements*

## goals:
[ ] put this on ghpages
  (however you do that now) so I can just point to it whenever I need to generate a QR code but I don't want to load umpteen megabytes of CSS and advertising shit
